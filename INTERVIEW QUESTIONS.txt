WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRUNCATE , DELETE AND DROP ?
delete:  using delete command we can delete entire data and we can delete a particular data by using where condition.
             if you delete it we can restore the data but with truncate we cann't restore the data.
            when you do a truncate it will not allow to delete one particular data or a single data it will delete entire data but the structure ramins the same and the columns names are remains the same
 drop: it will delete entire data with column names and table itself.
           whenever the table is not completely required that time will do drop commmand.
it will delete permanently deleted or lost from a database and they cann't be roll back

   the table has no more used it now then we go for drop command
